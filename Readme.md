# Tidy Tuesday 20200225

A tidy analysis for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) dataset for [2020-02-25](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-25) (American Measles Vaccination in Schools).

This was started using the [cookiecutter-r-dataanalysis-template](https://github.com/bdcaf/cookiecutter-r-data-analysis).
The output is hosted at [bdcaf](https://bdcaf.github.io/post/dev/tidytuesday/td20200225/).

It's not a complete workflow. 
Cleanup happens in `scripts/create_measles.R` - executed with `make data/measles.RDS`.
The plotting is in `doc/measles.Rmd`. The figure from the last section is the published one.  Unfortunately the plot takes forever and I didn't manage to put emojis in the labels.
