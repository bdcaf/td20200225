# td20180225

This was started using the [cookiecutter-r-dataanalysis-template](https://github.com/bdcaf/cookiecutter-r-data-analysis).

It's not a complete workflow. 
Cleanup happens in `scripts/create_measles.R` - executed with `make data/measles.RDS`.
The plotting is in `doc/measles.Rmd`. The figure from the last section is the published one.  Unfortunately the plot takes forever and I didn't manage to put emojis in the labels.
