```{r}
library(pander)
```

This is a shortened version of the data shown at
[Cern](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/300).  Just imagine the data
would be a gigabyte sized file - so you wouldn't want to keep
downloading it for every run.

These lines in the Makefile download it - however I prefer to include
it in the file `data-raw/Makefile`:
```
Jpsimumu.csv:
	curl "http://opendata.cern.ch/record/545/files/Jpsimumu.csv" -o "$@"
```

So I can here use it locally:

```{r}
jpsi <- read.csv("data-raw/Jpsimumu.csv")
```


Some fancy table
----------------

```{r}
pander::pander( head(jpsi), 
       caption="head of the table")
```

i could follow through the tutorial...  
however suppose in a larger project you'd like the results cached and
functions split into several files.  the mass data is created in the
makefile with the rules for `data/mass.rdata`  - note the
`r/create_mass.r` is automatically added to the dependencies.

heres the lines from `dependencies.makefile`:

```
data/mass.rdata: dataraw/jpsimumu.csv r/cern_invmass.r r/cern_magnitude.r
```

I then can just load it:

```{r}
jpsimass <- readRDS("data/mass.RDS")
```


And a plot
----------

```{r some_plot, fig.cap="the histogram from the tutorial"}
hist(jpsimass, breaks = 500, xlab = "Mass (GeV)", lty="blank", col=rgb(0,0,1,1/4), main="Invariant Mass Histogram")
```
